    Well in the merry month of May now from me home I started
    Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
    Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
    Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
    Then off to reap the corn, and leave where I was born 
    Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins
    A brand new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogues
    And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin
