    Well in the merry month of May now from me home I started <br>
    Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted <br>
    Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother <br>
    Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother <br>
    Then off to reap the corn, and leave where I was born <br>
    Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins <br>
    A brand new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogues <br>
    And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin <br>
